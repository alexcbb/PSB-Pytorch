# Unofficial PSB : Parallelized Spatiotemporal Binding

## 💪 Goal
This repo aims to reproduce and open the results obtained from "Parallelized Spatiotemporal Binding".


## ✅ TODO list :
- [x] Create README
- [x] Prepare issues labels
### Model
- [x] Prepare the layers
### Training 
- [x] Prepare the training loop
- [x] Create a simple dataset (CLEVRER)
- [x] Launch a PSB training
- [ ] Launch an original SAVi training
- [ ] Compare the accuracies & the training times
### Further experiments
- [ ] Train the model on other datasets
- [ ] Launch training on MOVi datasets
### Improving the model ? 
- [ ] Combine with DINOSAUR/VIDEOSAUR
